### ðŸ˜€ Heyyyy 
I'm a brazilian telecomunications student in ETE FMC technical school. Beyond that, I'm a programmer who loves solving problems.

## ðŸš€ Studies
Current, I'm mastering the JavaScript stack (Node.js, ReactJS and React Native), but I decided back some steps and make the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. This course are adding serious knowledges that I gonna carry with me all my carrer. 

## ðŸ˜Ž Jobs

- Backend Web Development (Node.js and Express)
- Frontend Web development (HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS or ReactJS)
- Cross platform Mobile Development (with React Native)
- Eletronical projects (Arduino and MSP430)
