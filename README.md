### ðŸ˜€ About me
Iâ€™m a student of telecommunications at the technical school ETE FMC. Furthermore, I am a programmer who loves to solve problems.

### ðŸš€ Studies
I am currently mastering the JavaScript stack (Node.js, ReactJS and React Native), but I decided to go back a few steps and take the CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science" course. This course is adding important knowledge that I will take with me throughout my career.

### ðŸ˜Ž Jobs
For now, I'm just developing my programming skills. However, Iâ€™m willing to accept any opportunity that appears. I can work on projects that involve: 
- Backend Web Development (Node.js and Express)
- Frontend Web development (HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS or ReactJS)
- Cross platform Mobile Development (with React Native)
- Eletronical projects (Arduino and MSP430)
- UI/UX design
